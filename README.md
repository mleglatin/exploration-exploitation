# exploration-exploitation
Python code inspired by the work of James March in 1991 on the exploration and exploration patterns in an organization.
See March, J. G. (1991). Exploration and exploitation in organizational learning. Organization Science, 2, 71â€“87. for more details.

Note, it is not functional yet. I will use this page to provide some results once it is working again.
